"""This module is the front end to a final project
It allows a tester to name a program file with infix expressions
and function definitions, which are ultimately compiled into
instructions for an emulated machine.

After the input has been examined and compiled,
it is executed on the simulated machine and the results displayed.

This module is intended for the benefit of the students
taking CMPSC 122 at the Pennsylvania State University
during the Spring Semester of 2017, and is not intended
for any other audience, or to distributed outside of the course.
